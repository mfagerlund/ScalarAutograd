# Parametric Sketch Solver Demo - Project Plan

## Overview
A **juicy**, interactive parametric sketch editor inspired by Fusion 360's sketch mode, showcasing ScalarAutograd's nonlinear least squares solver. Users create geometric entities (points, lines, circles) and apply constraints, with the system continuously solving to maintain constraint satisfaction while allowing interactive manipulation.

## Core Entities

### Point
- Position: `(x, y)`
- Can be free or constrained
- Visual: Circle with radius based on zoom level

### Line
- Connects two points (start, end)
- Constraints:
  - **Horizontal**: `y1 = y2`
  - **Vertical**: `x1 = x2`
  - **Fixed Length**: `distance(p1, p2) = length`
  - **Free**: No intrinsic constraints

### Circle
- Center point + radius
- Constraints:
  - **Fixed Radius**: `radius = value`
  - **Free Radius**: Solver decides

## Inter-Entity Constraints

1. **Coincident** (implicit): Shared points between entities
2. **Collinear**: Two lines share the same infinite line
3. **Parallel**: Two lines have same direction
4. **Perpendicular**: Two lines at 90Â°
5. **Angle**: Two lines at specified angle (degrees)
6. **Point-on-Line**: Point lies anywhere on line ray
7. **Point-on-Circle**: Point lies on circle perimeter
8. **Tangent**: Line is tangent to circle
9. **Radial-Alignment**: Point, circle center, and another point are collinear (for tangent normal constraints)

## Solver Behavior

- **Continuous solving**: Runs on every change (entity creation, constraint addition, drag movement)
- **Drag interaction**: Mouse position acts as a temporary "attractor" constraint with high weight - system solves in real-time as mouse moves, restricting point to solvable positions
- **Free entities**: Maintain current position unless influenced by constraints
- **Over-constrained detection**: Show error state visually, halt solving, display message
- **Under-constrained**: Allow solver to find valid solution (may have multiple solutions)

## User Interactions

### Selection
- Click to select (highlight)
- Shift+click for multi-select
- Click empty space to deselect all
- Selected entities have glow/highlight effect

### Creation (Toolbar + Keyboard)
- **Point** (P): Click to place
- **Line** (L): Click point â†’ click point (creates new point if clicking empty space)
- **Circle** (C): Click center point â†’ drag for radius (or click second point for radius)

### Manipulation
- **Drag**: Click and drag points/entities (solver maintains constraints in real-time)
- **Delete** (Delete/Backspace): Remove selected entities (cascade delete connected entities)

### Constraints (Context-Sensitive UI)
- Select entities â†’ constraint buttons appear based on selection:
  - 1 line: Horizontal, Vertical, Fix Length
  - 2 lines: Parallel, Perpendicular, Angle, Collinear
  - 1 point + 1 line: Point-on-Line
  - 1 point + 1 circle: Point-on-Circle
  - 1 line + 1 circle: Tangent
  - 2 points + 1 circle: Radial-Alignment

### Properties Panel
- Selected entity/constraint shows editable values:
  - Line length (if fixed)
  - Circle radius (if fixed)
  - Angle value
- Edit numerically â†’ solver updates

## Visual Design (Make it JUICY)

### Animations & Feedback
- **Smooth solving**: Animate entity positions during solve (spring interpolation)
- **Constraint satisfaction pulse**: Briefly flash green when constraint becomes satisfied
- **Selection**: Smooth glow animation, scale pulse on select
- **Hover effects**: Entities brighten/scale slightly
- **Drag**: Entity follows cursor with slight lag (easing), shows "ghost" at rest position
- **Creation**: Rubber-band effect for lines/circles during creation
- **Delete**: Fade out + slight rotation

### Visual Style
- **Entities**:
  - Points: Filled circles, larger when selected
  - Lines: Clean strokes, thicker when selected
  - Circles: Dashed or solid stroke
- **Constraints**:
  - Constraint symbols near entities (âŠ¥ for perpendicular, âˆ¥ for parallel, etc.)
  - Dimension annotations for fixed lengths/angles
- **Colors**:
  - Default: Cool blue/gray
  - Selected: Bright cyan/electric blue
  - Constrained: Subtle green tint
  - Over-constrained: Red
  - Hover: Yellow/gold highlight
- **Grid**: Subtle dot grid, snaps for precise placement (toggleable)

### Particle Effects
- **Constraint added**: Small particle burst at constraint location
- **Solve success**: Subtle shimmer across satisfied constraints
- **Over-constrained**: Red warning particles

## Technical Notes

### Solver Integration
- All entity positions are `V.W()` (trainable parameters)
- Fixed values (lengths, radii, angles) are `V.C()` (constants)
- Drag position is temporary `V.C()` that gets removed after drag ends
- Use high residual weight for drag constraint to prioritize user intent

### Performance
- Debounce solver during rapid changes (but not during drag - that needs real-time)
- Only rebuild constraint residuals when constraints change, not when positions change
- Consider spatial hashing for large sketches

### Error Handling
- Solver divergence â†’ freeze last valid state, show error
- Numerical instability â†’ add small epsilon to prevent division by zero
- Over-constrained â†’ detect via solver failure + constraint count heuristic
