description: Verify that all tests and builds are green across the board. Iterate on fixing until done.
---

Verify that all tests and builds pass successfully. Follow this process:

1. Run the build command (`npm run build`)
2. Run the test suite (`npm run test`)
3. If either fails:
   - Analyze the error messages
   - Fix the issues found
   - Re-run the build and tests
4. Continue iterating until both build and tests pass completely
5. Report when everything is green

Use the TodoWrite tool to track progress through these steps.
